        <div>
            <h3>Packs stat sheet yet again</h3>
            <p>
                Hart turned in an efficient shooting performance, drilling a pair of triples for a third straight appearance. 
                He also showed why he's such a valuable all-around contributor with his effort on the boards and as a passer. 
                Hart's heavy workload along with his ability to post diverse final lines should continue to be valuable for fantasy managers.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Adds 11 points off bench</h3>
           <p>
            Payne led the New York bench in scoring and did so with a strong showing from beyond the arc. 
            He's enjoyed an expanded role for this Knicks team of late due to the absence of Miles McBride (knee), as he's averaged 26.7 minutes over his previous three appearances after averaging 15.4 minutes across his first nine games of the 2024-25 campaign.
           </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Paces scoring attack</h3>
            <p>Anunoby led the Knicks in scoring and turned in his best offensive performance of the season to date. He also tied his best mark of the 2024-25 campaign in steals and has now tallied seven over his last three games. Anunoby should continue to be a strong all-around contributor for fantasy managers moving forward, though this type of scoring production is unlikely to occur on a consistent basis.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Isaac Nogues</h3>
            <p>Provides spark off bench Sunday Although he didn't offer much in the scoring column with a passive role on offense, Nogues made a big impact as a facilitator and defender with his eight dimes and four swipes off the bench. The 20-year-old guard hasn't seen much court time as a reserve for the Remix this season, playing at least 16 minutes from the second unit in just two of his five games, but similar showings to Sunday's could afford him a more stable spot in Rip City's rotation going forward.
        </p>
        <div>
            <h3>Henri Drell</h3>
            <p>
                Season-high 27 points in win Drell emerged with a season-high 27 points in Sunday's victory over the G League Suns, also pacing Rip City with his 12 boards. The 24-year-old forward also notched his second consecutive double-double with the strong performance, and he's now scored at least 16 points in four of his past five games for the Remix.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Moses Wood</h3>
            <p>Stays hot from deep in G League Wood's production across the board has mostly been limited to points and threes thus far this season, but he managed to fill the box score in Sunday's defeat to the Remix and also hit double figures in scoring for the fifth time in seven appearances for the G League Suns. The 25-year-old sharpshooter has certainly displayed plenty of accuracy from distance, however, shooting 47.7 percent over 45 field-goal attempts from downtown in 2024-25.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Eric Washington</h3>
            <p>Gets back on track Sunday Washington's 13 assists easily marked a game-high figure in Sunday's defeat to Rip City, and he provided a well-rounded stat line along with his first double-double of the season for the G League Suns despite his five turnovers. The 31-year-old veteran guard entered Sunday's game shooting a paltry 19.4 percent from the field over his previous six contests this season, but he's now dished out at least eight dimes in each of his past three outings as part of the Valley starting lineup.
